Day 1, 7:05

Good morning!

I woke up at about 4:00 am today which is 2 hours after the compo starts to read the theme, then did a little brainstorming and went back to bed, now it's 7:05 am I'm in the process of waking up.

My plan is to make a game about "Gravitational slingshots", but misunderstood: Humanity has mounted a giant grappling hook onto the north and south pole that they will use to connect themselves to other celestial objects and pull themselves to an epic space journey :D

Plan is to 

	- Research how to do orbital mechanics in games
	- Get those implemented
	- Find some kind of goal to go with the gameplay
		o A Puzzle/Racing game?

	- Implement that goal

If I have extra time:

	- Graphics
	- Sound
	- Multiple levels
	- Procedural universe generation

Now first for some tea, though.  After the basics are set up.
I'll be using my DarlingJS base code as announced.



--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 8:35

Phew, orbital mechanics seem a little tricky! I wanted to use the real-word data for the celestial objects masses, etc. but so far I still seem to be having some problems of scale. I guess that there is some conversion factor that I'm still missing somewhere so I'll go hunt for it after another small tea break.

On the other hand, I already have some shitty developer graphics for my main actors ready :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 10:14

OK, it's half-working now although I had to give up on my idea of using real-universe measurements - the units of magnitude are just too different to get things working well and it's easier to just fiddle with the magic numbers until the behavior is as intended. Next up: TURRET!


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 11:06

Had to play around a bit with the sizing of the turret w.r.t the earth but this should work now. Giant turret is now successfully mounted on the north pole and can rotate. Next up: Probably some more planets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 11:53

All planets of our solar system are painted and added to the game, although they don't have a particularly stable orbit yet. It looks fun though! 

I'll have to look into how to add zoom so that you can see the whole solar system (and beyond!)

Before that, a small break though!


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 13:00

Ended up doing turret shooting first. It might be pretty hard to hit planets with this thing. Now another small break and then getting the zoom done!

This probably means crawling through the Pixi.js code.


13:30: I think I have a plan. Because pixi.js and Darling.js don't seem to support any kind of zoom as far as I can tell, I'll have to roll my own world -> screen coordinate converter. Good that I implemented my own physics so I don't have to do it now :D


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 14:50

I've implemented my own system for world coordinates that are mapped to DarlingJS ng2D coordinates and that supports a zoom value. Everything is working again except for switching textures for the turret. I'll look through the darlingjs examples whether there is a better way than how I'm currently doing it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 15:41

Did a workaround to the texture swapping: The explosion effect of the gun is now added as a separate entity. I don't think there will be any real animations for this project so this should be good enough.

Break time!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1, 16:41

Added the actual grappling hook pulling effect and played around with planetary masses for a while. Moving around with a grappling hook is interesting, but I'm still not sure what to do gameplay-wise. Probably different victory conditions like 'make planet crash into sun' or 'leave solar system', etc.
